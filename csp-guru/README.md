# CSP.guru
An open-source database of all concentrating solar power plants of the world for energy modellers and analysts. This version of CSP.guru reflects the status of CSP projects as of 1st of January 2021.

## About
This dataset holds technical, economic, financial, and industrial data on all operating concentrating solar power stations and of stations under construction, as well as several pilot stations. For detailed description of the data collection procedure, please see the initial article for which the dataset was compiled [Lilliestam et al. (2017)](https://doi.org/10.1038/nenergy.2017.94).


## Data Package
We provide the data in form of a [tabular data package](https://frictionlessdata.io/specs/tabular-data-package/) that consists of a CSV (comma separated values) file holding the actual data and a single JSON file (`datapackage.json`) holding the metadata.

## Changes in this version of CSP.guru
This is the third version of CSP.guru produced during the openCSP project. And reflects the state of play at the beginning of 2021. Additional data on the Chinese CSP stations was included based on information from [Chuncheng Zang](mailto:zangchch@mail.iee.ac.cn) and [Alina Gilmanova](mailto:alina@mail.iee.ac.cn). Two additional projects are under construction named: Shenzhen Jinfan Akesai - 50MW Molten Salt Trough OpenCSP ID:132, and Shouhang Yumen 100 MW Tower openCSP ID: 133.
